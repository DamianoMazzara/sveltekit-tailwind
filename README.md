# sveltekit-tailwind

This project is the result obtained by setting up svelte-kit without typescript plus tailwind 2.2.

Tailwind 2.2 comes with JIT that's already configured in tailwind.config.cjs.

The project contains postcss too.

Scripts inside composer.json automatically generate src/styles/tailwind-output.css with the processed css.

Remember to run npm install afrer cloning the repo.
